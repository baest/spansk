Current status

Right now cli somewhat works.

Web part is nothing but a blank frontpage

Web
---------------------------

Web should have the following:

1. Start page. Introduce and start the game

2. Question (save the form id and verb in hidden or maybe session)

3. Answer (correct/incorrect) and new question

4. Finish game, present result


Run web part
---------------------------

To run spansk install all dependencies (guess) and run

./spansk.pl daemon
